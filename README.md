# A-Blog
A-Blog is an anonymous body log.

## Motivation
I wanted to learn how to build web applications using the Rust backend.
I am a backend / data engineer, meaning frontend work is very alien for me, so I 
tried to make the frontend part as easy as possible.

Also I wanted to build the basic building blocks myself, so that I can reuse this
as a template for potential future projects.

## Features
In essence this is just a CRUD app.

- Register
- Login
- Logout
- Entering Data

Planned features:

- Proper design for registering
- Removing data
- Exporting data
- Data analytics
- Auth scopes (maybe?)
